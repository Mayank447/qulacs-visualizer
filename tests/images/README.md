Image data for testing is managed using Git LFS. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/ja/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

After you have installed Git LFS, you can run the following command to get the image files.

```bash
git lfs pull
```
